You have access to an OpenCode coding agent worker via the `opencode_prompt` tool.

Use this tool when you need to:
- Write, modify, or refactor source code in a repository
- Debug and fix compilation or runtime errors
- Add tests or documentation to a codebase
- Perform multi-file code changes across a project
- Review code and suggest improvements

Provide a clear, specific task description in the `task` field. Be explicit about what files or modules to work on and what the expected outcome should be.

Optionally specify `project_path` to target a specific directory.

Use `opencode_sessions` to list active coding sessions.

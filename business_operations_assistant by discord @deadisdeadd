# StarkBot Business Operations Assistant
**Hackathon Submission – Business Operations Track**

## What it does
Makes StarkBot your 24/7 virtual COO / ops team member:
- Triages incoming emails → summarize, prioritize, draft replies
- Schedules meetings / reminders using calendar integrations or memory-based cron
- Maintains lightweight CRM in memory graph (contacts, deals, notes)
- Sends invoice/payment reminders (crypto or fiat via x402)
- Generates daily/weekly ops reports (tasks done, emails handled, upcoming deadlines)
- Delegates subtasks to other agents or humans via Discord/X/Slack

Leverages existing StarkBot features: heartbeat (background runs), memory graph (persistent CRM/tasks), scheduling.md (cron), notes.md (logging), x402 (payments/reminders).

## Activation & Background Mode
Tell StarkBot:  
`use business_operations_assistant with command is activate`

→ Spawns Ops Sub-Agent that runs every heartbeat (15 min default):
- Checks pending emails/tasks in memory
- Processes triage/scheduling/reminders
- Logs actions as memory entities

## Core Workflows (Ops Sub-Agent Instructions)

### 1. Email Triage & Drafting
- On heartbeat or trigger: use `web_fetch` or email tool to scan inbox (if API key)
- Classify: urgent / deal / community / spam / invoice
- Summarize thread + draft reply (professional or degen tone per SOUL)
- Store draft in memory → ask for approval before `send_email`
- Example: "High priority: Investor DM about token allocation"

### 2. Calendar & Scheduling
- Parse natural language requests → create `schedule_task` cron entries
- Check conflicts via memory_retrieve("calendar")
- Send reminders via email/Discord/X (e.g. 30 min before)
- Example: "Schedule investor call next Tuesday 3PM UTC"

### 3. Lightweight CRM
- Entity types in memory graph:
  - Contact:{wallet/email} → name, role, last_interaction, notes, deal_stage
  - Task:{id} → description, due_date, status, assigned_to
- Commands: add note, update stage (lead → closed), list open deals

### 4. Invoice & Payment Reminders
- Track unpaid invoices in memory (amount, due_date, recipient_wallet)
- Daily scan: if overdue → auto-send reminder via email/X + x402 link
- Optional: auto-tip small bounties for completed tasks

### 5. Daily Ops Report
- Every 24h: aggregate actions (emails handled, tasks completed, upcoming)
- Format nice summary → post to Discord/Slack or store in notes
- Include metrics: "Handled 12 emails, scheduled 3 meetings, 2 invoices sent"

### 6. Task Delegation
- Break big requests into subtasks
- Assign to self (via heartbeat), other StarkBot agents, or ping human on channel

## Usage Examples

**Example 1 – Activate full assistant**

→ Bot starts background ops loop, sends first report after 1 cycle.

**Example 2 – Triage inbox now**

→ Processes recent emails, drafts replies, asks confirmation.

**Example 3 – Schedule something**

→ Follow-up prompt: "When and with who?"

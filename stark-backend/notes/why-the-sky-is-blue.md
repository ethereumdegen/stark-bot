# Why the Sky is Blue

# Why the Sky is Blue

The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**.

## How it works:

- Sunlight contains all colors of the visible spectrum
- As light enters Earth's atmosphere, it collides with gas molecules (mainly nitrogen and oxygen)
- Shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) scatter more easily than longer wavelengths (red, orange)
- Blue light is scattered in all directions by the atmospheric particles
- This scattered blue light reaches our eyes from all parts of the sky

## Why not violet?

Violet light actually scatters even more than blue, but:
- The sun emits less violet light than blue
- Our eyes are more sensitive to blue
- Some violet light is absorbed by the upper atmosphere

The result is the familiar blue sky we see during clear days.
